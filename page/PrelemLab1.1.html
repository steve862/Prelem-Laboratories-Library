    <h1>The Best Movie According to Clark Cruz</h1>
    <h2>My top 10 movies of all time.</h2>
    <hr/>
    <h3>Nobody</h3>
    <p>Bob Odenkirk takes an unexpected turn in Ilya Naishuller’s “Nobody,” a clever action flick that repositions the star of “Better Call Saul” as someone closer to Liam Neeson’s action heroes. While imagining one of the brilliant minds behind “Mr. Show” as an action hero may seem like a stretch, it turns out to be a stroke of genius as Odenkirk grounds his violent protagonist with a very special set of skills in a way that other actors would have missed. He’s great as a man who has tried to leave a violent past behind, but movies have taught us for generations that that’s easier said than done.</p>

    <h3>WALL-E</h3>
    <p>Pixar’s “WALL-E” succeeds at being three things at once: an enthralling animated film, a visual wonderment and a decent science-fiction story. After “Kung Fu Panda,” I thought I had just about exhausted my emergency supply of childlike credulity, but here is a film, like “Finding Nemo,” that you can enjoy even if you’ve grown up. That it works largely without spoken dialogue is all the more astonishing; it can easily cross language barriers, which is all the better, considering that it tells a planetary story.</p>

    <h3>The Rip</h3>
    <p>Joe Carnahan, the director of gritty cop flicks like “Narc” and “Copshop,” is back in his wheelhouse with the effectively entertaining “The Rip,” the rare Netflix original action film that actually plays like something you’d want to see in theaters. BFFs Matt Damon and Ben Affleck lean into their age a bit more than usual to play world-weary Miami cops faced with the allure of corruption. Carnahan sets up his players, the backdrop of the dangerous world against which this will unfold and then bounces them off one another in a way that keeps audiences guessing. Through it all, the Oscar winners for “Good Will Hunting” do strong character work, especially Damon, elevating “The Rip” even further. This is the kind of staple on basic cable channels like TNT that old men like to rail about not getting made anymore. They’ll eat it up and be satisfied by this old-fashioned meal.</p>

    <h3>Sisu: Road to Revenge</h3>
    <p>“Sisu: Road to Revenge” is to “Sisu” as “Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn” is to “Evil Dead.” It’s a film with a similar structure and stakes that’s bigger, crazier, and more willing to lean into action and comedy dynamics that feel inspired by silent filmmaking. It’s an absolute blast of an action movie, another showcase for Jalmari Helander’s increasing skill with action choreography and inventive set pieces. Jorma Tommila returns as the franchise’s silent hero, a new variation on Mad Max in this thrill ride that’s also clearly inspired by George Miller’s action orgies. There’s a sequence early in the film under a chapter card that reads “Motor Mayhem” that’s basically “Sisu: Fury Road,” and it’s one of the most purely thrilling riffs on that 2015 masterpiece that hit theaters in the decade since. “Road to Revenge” reimagines everything that worked about “Sisu,” but it does what an action sequel should do and builds on it instead of just repeating the same barely-controlled chaos. This movie rules.</p>

    <h3>F1</h3>
    <p>Heading into “F1,” a high-octane, ‘rise from the ashes’ star vehicle, Brad Pitt is clearly considering his image. Lately, the actor has inspired more headlines about his tumultuous divorce from Angelina Jolie—spurred by a reportedly drunken domestic assault on a 2016 plane trip—than for his movies. In his most recent works (“Wolfs” and “Babylon”), Pitt has portrayed talented, weathered men whose stares down mortality could reflect the actor’s own anxiety about his position in an industry searching for younger, squeaky-clean faces to take his place. “F1” ratchets up these worries. </p>

    <h3>World War Z</h3>
    <p>“World War Z” plays as if someone watched the similar “28 Days Later” and thought, “That was a good movie, but it would be better if it cost $200 million, there were armies of zombies, and the hero were perfect and played by Brad Pitt.” Which is another way of saying that if you need proof that sometimes more can be less, here you go. Directed by Marc Forster and written by everyone in Hollywood, if rumors are to be believed (though three got credit), this adaptation of Max Brooks’ oral history of a zombie apocalypse…</p>

    <h3>Magellan</h3>
    <p>The founder of this site, one of the great film critics, once pronounced, “No good movie is too long, and no bad movie is short enough.” That’s a very reliable critical yardstick. After applying it, all one has to do is determine whether a given movie is any good. </p>

    <h3>Chernobyl</h3>
    <p>HBO’s excellent five-hour mini-series “Chernobyl” ends with the words, “In memory of all who suffered and sacrificed.” It’s a fitting final note for a series that ably pays homage to just those people, from the workers who died in the explosion to those who fought to keep it contained to the scientists who spoke up to make sure it didn’t happen again. Brilliantly structured and anchored by great performances from Jared Harris, Emily Watson, Stellan Skarsgard, and more, “Chernobyl” is relentlessly bleak, but it has a remarkable cumulative power. I found each hour more impressive than the one before it, as Johan Renck’s complex, layered vision of an entire nation altered by a nuclear event becomes more and more devastating.</p>

    <h3>Stranger Things: The Finale</h3>
    <p>“Stranger Things” ended on New Year’s Eve 2025 with screenings in theaters across the country and loyal fans counting down to the launch on Netflix. After the truly bizarre response to the second volume of the final season that saw some of the worst media literacy in years—there was even a viral theory that Noah Schnapp’s Will was really Vecna in disguise for most of the second volume, including during the coming-out scene, which makes less sense than Flat Earth—and divided (and some depressingly homophobic) responses to Schnapp’s big moment, the buzz around “The Rightside Up” was as high as something can be in pop culture in the 2020s. So did the Duffers stick the landing and send these popular characters off in style? Yes and no. The finale falls victim to some of the issues that plagued the entire inferior season, but it’s hard to deny the power of the last half-hour, the scenes when the show returns to the people we love instead of the chaos and finds itself one last time.</p>

    <h3>Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle</h3>
    <p>If you’ve paid even the slightest bit of attention to Japanese anime in the past five years, you’ve no doubt heard of “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba” at some point. Since its premiere in spring 2019, the dark fantasy anime (based on Koyoharu Gotouge’s 2016 original manga) has amassed a dedicated worldwide fanbase along with massive commercial success. The first feature-length film in the series, “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Mugen Train,” opened in theaters and defied the odds to become the highest-grossing film of 2020, amassing over $506 million in a year wracked by a global pandemic that throttled box office revenue worldwide. Now, after five years and four subsequent seasons of television, the anime has returned to theaters, this time with the first in a trilogy of films set to adapt the manga’s climactic final arc, and the audiences have once again returned in record numbers.</p>
